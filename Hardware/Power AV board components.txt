== Electrolytic Capacitors ==
C501 470uF 6.3v
C502 330uF 6.3v
C504 100uF 10v (POLARITY MARKED WRONG)
C509 1000uF 35v
C522,C524,C526,C527 470uF 10v
C532 100uF 35v
C533 100uF 6.3v

IMPORTANT: install C504 opposite to marking, or remove and cover holes to avoid confusion.
C509,C532 should NOT be low ESR. Low ESR is recommended for all others but not required.
C502,C533 can be substituted with 470uF for improved video quality.

6.3v can be substituted with 10v, or 16v if necessary. 10v can be substituted with 16v.

Cheap recap shopping list:
7x 470uF 10v LowESR
1x 100uF 35v
1x 1000uF 35v

VR501 ALPS RK09K1110-K20-C1-B103 10K potentiometer center detent (RK09K1110A0J nearest standard part)

Recommended to replace R521 with 4.5K *OR* replace R522 with 1.56K to drop VCC from 5.2v to 5.0v.
Suggested safe method is to lift one side of R522 and install a 68R resistor in series.
R507,R508 may be replaced with 100R to raise output level.
