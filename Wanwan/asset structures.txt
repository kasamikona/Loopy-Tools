Compression is a variant of LZ77/LZSS. See extractor implementation.


Palette:
(Uncompressed)
- u16 numColors
- u16[numColors] colors

BitmapImage8bpp:
(Compressed, associated with a Palette)
- u8 width (0 means 256)
- u8 height (0 means 256)
- u8[width*height] imageData

MetaSprite:
(Uncompressed, associated with a TileSheet4bpp and Palette)
- u16 unknown1 (usually 1, anything nonzero works)
- u16 dataOffset (always 4, data immediately follows)
- u8 numSprites
- for numSprites entries:
  - u8 tileIndex (relative to sheet?)
  - s8 offsetX (relative to metasprite position)
  - s8 offsetY (relative to metasprite position)
  - u8 attributes (OAM flipx/flipy/size, may include subpal and position MSBs)

TileSheet4bpp:
(Compressed)
- u16 numTiles
- for numTiles entries:
  - u8[32] tileData
