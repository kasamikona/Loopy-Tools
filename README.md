# Kasami's Loopy Tools Collection

This is a collection of tools, scripts and info that I have created/gathered in my research and
development work on the Casio Loopy. There isn't a whole lot here yet. The collection will grow as
time goes on, but some parts may split off into dedicated repos.  

**Please do not use my tools for creating controversial or offensive content.**  
I feel that the demographic of the Loopy including the modern community is not a suitable place for this.
I can't stop you from doing anything, but I will blacklist you and certainly won't provide support if you do so.
You may contact me privately if you want more of an explanation of why this notice is here.
