# Kasami's Loopy Tools Collection

This is a collection of tools, scripts and info that I have created/gathered in my research and
development work on the Casio Loopy. There isn't a whole lot here yet. The collection will grow as
time goes on, but some parts may split off into dedicated repos.  

## Repo Contents

- CompilerTemplate: A preliminary C toolchain for compiling very simple Loopy code.
- Documentation: Research findings and datasheets.
- Hardware: Parts for custom designed hardware like flash carts, mods etc.
- SerialDumper: A tool to dump cartridges using the Loopy console itself with a serial mod.
- Tools: General tools and scripts for ROM analysis and manipulation etc.
- Wanwan: Tools and scripts focused on researching and modifying the Wanwan Aijou Monogatari game.
